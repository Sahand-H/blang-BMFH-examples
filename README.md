# blang-BMFH-examples
Trying to implement examples in https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/  in blang using the BlangIDE, which can be found here: https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/blang/Blang_IDE.html

Each example directory contains the relevant .bl file along with the output from running the model.

Also includes a python and R file that should plot the distribution of a given random variable from the models (variables declared as a random type in the .bl file) by entering the name in the relevant section in the files.
